## makeSqlmancerSchema

```ts
function makeSqlmancerSchema(config: IExecutableSchemaDefinition): GraphQLSchema
```

Sqlmancer uses schema directives to do its magic, so these have to be added to your schema. This function is a convenient wrapper around `makeExecutableSchema` that does that for you. For configuration options, see [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema/#makeexecutableschemaoptions).

## createSqlmancerClient

```ts
function createSqlmancerClient<
  T extends GenericSqlmancerClient = GenericSqlmancerClient
>(
  glob: string,
  knex: Knex
): T

type GenericSqlmancerClient = Knex & {
  models: Record<
    string,
    {
      findById: (id: ID) => FindByIdBuilder
      findMany: () => FindManyBuilder
      findOne: () => FindOneBuilder
      aggregate: () => AggregateBuilder
      createMany?: (input: Array<any>) => CreateManyBuilder
      createOne?: (input: any) => CreateOneBuilder
      deleteById?: (id: ID) => DeleteByIdBuilder
      deleteMany?: () => DeleteManyBuilder
      updateById?: (id: ID, input: any) => UpdateByIdBuilder
      updateMany?: (input: any) => UpdateManyBuilder
    }
  >
}
```

This function builds a database client from your type definitions and an instance of Knex. The [glob pattern](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) you provide should match the relative path of any type definitions you want Sqlmancer to parse. The type definitions may either be plain text files (for example `.graphql` files) or JavaScript or TypeScript files. If you target JavaScript or TypeScript files, make sure your type definitions are defined using the [graphql-tag](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) template literal tag.

The initialized client object includes a `models` map. Each model exposes several CRUD methods, each of which will return an appropriate query builder instance. The available methods for these query builders are described [here](builders).

If you're using TypeScript, the type for your client instance can be generated using the [CLI](cli).
