## Offset-based pagination
Sqlmancer supports offset pagination using the `limit` and `offset` methods.

```js
Actor.findMany().limit(10).offset(20);
```

## Keyset pagination
While Sqlmancer doesn't explicitly support cursor-based pagination, you can still utilize keyset pagination. Keyset pagination is often more performant than offset-based pagination, particularly on large data sets. The field used as the cursor needs to be sortable and unique. For example, you can use the primary key field

```js
Film.findMany()
  .where({ id: { greaterThan: someId } })
  .orderBy([{ id: 'ASC' }])
  .limit(10);
```

If you want to sort the results by a field that isn't necessarily unique, then you can combine that field with another field that *is* unique, like the primary key

```js
Film.findMany()
  .where({
    or: [
      {
        stars: { lessThan: someValue },
      },
      {
        and: {
          stars: { equal: someValue },
          id: { greaterThan: someId },
        }
      }
    ],
  })
  .orderBy([{ stars: 'DESC' }, { id: 'ASC' }])
  .limit(10);
```
