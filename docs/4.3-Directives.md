## @col

**Arguments**
* `name: String!`

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@col` directive is used to explicitly set the name of the corresponding column for a field. If the directive is not used, Sqlmancer will use the name of the field instead, applying whatever transformation to the field's name was configured.

## @depend

**Arguments**
* `on: [String!]!`

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@depend` directive is used to indicate a field is not associated with a particular column, but still *depends* on one or more columns. If the field is requested, the specified columns will be included in the request and available to the field's resolver.

## @hasDefault

**Arguments**
*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@hasDefault` directive is used to indicate the associated column has a default value. This means the field can have a non-nullable type without being required when creating a new instance of the model.

## @ignore

**Arguments**
*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@ignore` directive is used to indicate the field has no associated column. Note: if a `@depend` or `@join` directive is used on a field, an `@ignore` directive is not necessary.

## @join

**Arguments**
* `on: [{ from: String!, to: String! }]`
* `through: String`

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@join` directive is used to a relation with another model. The `on` argument consists of one or two objects, each having a `from` and `to` field. If no junction table is used, `on` should receive a single object with the `from` indicating a column on this model's table and the `to` indicating a column on the related model's table.

If a junction table is used, `on` should receive two objects. The first object's `from` would be a column on this model's table and its `to` would be a column on the junction table. The second object's `from` would be a column on the junction table and its `to` would be a column on the related model's table. If a function table is used, the `through` argument should be provided as well to indicate the name of the junction table.

## @limit

**Arguments**
*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@limit` directive adds a `limit` argument to the field with a type of `Int`.

## @offset

**Arguments**
*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@offset` directive adds an `offset` argument to the field with a type of `Int`.

## @orderBy

**Arguments**
* `model: String`

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@orderBy` directive adds an `orderBy` argument to the field with a generated input type based on the field's type. An optional `model` argument may be provided to ignore the field's type and use the indicated model instead.

## @model

**Arguments**
* `table: String!`
* `pk: String!`

**Targets**
* `INTERFACE`
* `OBJECT`
* `UNION`

The `@model` directive indicates a data model should be generated for the specified type. The `table` argument indicates the table name for the model, while the `pk` argument indicates the primary key column.

If the `@model` directive is used on a Union or Interface, then the fields of all possible types for that union or interface will be aggregated to determine the possible columns and associations for the model.

## @private

**Arguments**
*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`
* `INTERFACE`
* `OBJECT`
* `UNION`

The `@private` directive indicates a field or type should be removed from the schema. Sqlmancer will still parse fields and types removed this way when generating its data models. This allows you to include sensitive fields like passwords in the data model without exposing them through the API.

## @where

**Arguments**
* `model: String`

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@where` directive adds an `where` argument to the field with a generated input type based on the field's type. An optional `model` argument may be provided to ignore the field's type and use the indicated model instead.
