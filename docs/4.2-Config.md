You can include a configuration file in your project instead of passing the same options through the CLI. By default, Sqlmancer will look for a file named `sqlmancer.config.js` in whatever directory the command is ran from. The file should export a single object with one or more of the following properties:

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dialect` | `postgres` | SQL dialect of the database you are connecting to. Possible values: `postgres` |
| `transformFieldNames` | `undefined` | transformation applied to turn field names into column names. Possible values: `CAMEL_CASE`, `PASCAL_CASE`, `SNAKE_CASE` |
| `typeDefs` | `./**.*.graphql` | glob pattern to match any files containing your type definitions -- these can be plain text files or JavaScript/TypeScript files that use the `gql` tag |
| `output` | `./generate` | Relative path to a directory where the database client module will be generated. The directory will be created if it doesn't already exist. |
