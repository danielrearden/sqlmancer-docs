Query builders are initialized by calling the appropriate [client](client) method. Most builder methods return the builder instance, so method calls can be chained easily. The underlying query will not be executed until `execute` is called on the builder instance.

### `execute`
```ts
public async execute(): Promise<any>
```

**Available on:** *All Builder Classes*

Executes the query and returns a Promise with the result. The type of the result will depend on the Builder used and the options provided.

### `toQueryBuilder`
```ts
public toQueryBuilder(): Knex.QueryBuilder
```

**Available on:** *All Builder Classes*

Transforms the query builder instance into an instance of a Knex query builder.

### `transaction`
```ts
public transaction(transaction: Knex.Transaction | null): Builder
```

**Available on:** *All Builder Classes*

Sets the transaction to be used by the query.

### `select`
```ts
public select(...fields: ModelField[]): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindByIdBuilder`, `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`

Sets the `SELECT` clause for the query.

### `selectAll`
```ts
public selectAll(): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindByIdBuilder`, `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`

Sets the `SELECT` clause for the query to all possible fields.

### `addSelect`
```ts
public addSelect(...fields: ModelField[]): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindByIdBuilder`, `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`

Adds on to the `SELECT` clause for the query.

### `where`
```ts
public where(where: Where): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`, `UpdateManyBuilder`, `DeleteManyBuilder`

Sets the `WHERE` clause for the query.

### `mergeWhere`
```ts
public mergeWhere(where: Where): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`, `UpdateManyBuilder`, `DeleteManyBuilder`

Deep merges the provided object with the existing `WHERE` options for the query.

### `orderBy`
```ts
public orderBy(orderBy: OrderBy[]): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`, `UpdateManyBuilder`, `DeleteManyBuilder`

Sets the `ORDER BY` clause for the query.

### `limit`
```ts
public limit(value: number): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`, `UpdateManyBuilder`, `DeleteManyBuilder`

Sets the `LIMIT` for the query.

### `offset`
```ts
public offset(value: number): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`, `UpdateManyBuilder`, `DeleteManyBuilder`

Sets the `OFFSET` for the query.

### `join`
```ts
public join(name: string, getBuilder?: (builder: Builder) => Builder): Builder
public join(name: string, as: string, getBuilder?: (builder: Builder) => Builder): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindByIdBuilder`, `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`

Eager loads the specified model relation. An optional alias can be provided to return the related model or models under a different property name. The `getBuilder` parameter is a function that's passed a fresh `FindOneBuilder` or `FindManyBuilder` instance for the associated model and should return the same kind of Builder instance.

### 'resolveInfo'
```ts
public resolveInfo(info: GraphQLResolveInfo) => Builder): Builder
```

**Available on:** `FindByIdBuilder`, `FindOneBuilder`, `FindManyBuilder`

Modifies the query based on the passed in GraphQLResolveInfo object. The selection set will determine what columns should be selected and which related models should be joined. The `where`, `orderBy`, `limit` and `offset` arguments, if they exist on the field and were provided, will be used to set the corresponding clauses in the query.
