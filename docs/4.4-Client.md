## `createClient`

The generated module exports a createClient function with the following signature:

```ts
function createClient(knex: Knex): Client;

type Client = Knex & { models: ModelMap };

type ModelMap = Record<string, Model>;

type Model = {
  findById: (id: number | string) => <Model>FindByIdBuilder,
  findMany: () => <Model>FindManyBuilder,
  findOne: () => <Model>FindOneBuilder,
  createMany: (data: <Model>CreateFields[]) => <Model>CreateManyBuilder,
  createOne: (data: ${name}CreateFields) => <Model>CreateOneBuilder,
  updateById: (id: number | string, data: <Model>UpdateFields) => <Model>UpdateByIdBuilder,
  updateMany: (data: <Model>UpdateFields) => <Model>UpdateManyBuilder,
  deleteById: (id: number | string) => <Model>DeleteByIdBuilder,
  deleteMany: () => <Model>DeleteManyBuilder,
};
```

The initialized client object includes a `models` map. Each model exposes several CRUD methods, each of which will return an appropriate query builder instance. The available methods for these query builders are described [here](builders).
