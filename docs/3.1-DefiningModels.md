## Defining models

Use the `@model` directive on an object type definition to describe a data model. The `table` (table name) and `pk` (primary key) arguments are both required.

```graphql
type Actor @model(table: "actor", pk: "id") {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}
```

Any fields on the type will be included in the model as columns. By default, the column names will be expected to match the field names, but you may configure a transformation to apply to the field name (like `SNAKE_CASE`) to generate the appropriate column name. The `transformFieldNames` option must be provided through the [CLI](cli) or the [configuration file](config). To explicitly associate a field with a differently named column, use the `@col` directive. To not have a field included in the model at all, use the `@ignore` directive.

```graphql
type Film @model(table: "film", pk: "film_id") {
  id: ID! @col(name: "film_id")
  title: String!
  description: String!
  imdbInfo: ImdbInfo! @ignore
}
```

A column with a default value should have a non-nullable type for its respective field. However, a non-nullable type would also imply the field is required when creating a new record. To correct for this, use the `@hasDefault` directive to indicate the column has a default value.

```graphql
type Actor @model(table: "actor", pk: "id") {
  id: ID! @hasDefault
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}
```

## Defining virtual fields

It's possible to create *virtual* or *computed* fields by using the `@depend` directive. The columns passed to the directive's `on` argument will be added to the SQL query (if the field is requested) and can then be used inside the field's resolver. Note that the model may not include all of a table's columns, but any column can be passed to the `on` argument, even if it's not part of the model.

```graphql
type Actor @model(table: "actor", pk: "actor_id") {
  id: ID! @col(name: "actor_id")
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  fullName: String! @depend(on: ["first_name", "last_name"])
}
```

## Defining relationships

Relationships between models are defined using the `@join` directive. The directive's `on` argument takes an array of objects consisting of a `from` column and a `to` column. For a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship, there is a single object with the `from` identifying the column on this model and the `to` identifying the column on the related model. Note: regardless of where the foreign key is related, the `from` always reflects the current model.

```graphql
type Film @model(table: "film", pk: "film_id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String!
  language @join(on: [{ from: "language_id", to: "id" }]): Language!
  
  # Note: if there is only one "on" object, GraphQL allows you to
  # pass in just the object instead of a list:
  language @join(on: { from: "language_id", to: "id" }): Language!
}
```

Many-to-many relationships are defined similarly, but also provide a `through` argument to identify the join or junction table. They also include two "on" objects -- one joining the current model's table to the junction table and one joining the junction table to the related model.

```graphql
type Film @model(table: "film", pk: "film_id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String!
  actors @join(
    through: "actor_film",
    on: [{ from: "id", to: "film_id" }, { from: "actor_id", to: "id" }]
  ): [Actor!]!
}
```
