## Single Table Inheritance

Abstract types (unions and interfaces) can be used when you want a field to return two or more different object types. Modeling inheritance in relational databases is tricky, but can be accomplished by using [single table inheritance](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/singleTableInheritance.html). The basic idea is to create a single table that will represent all the models that will be lumped together. Columns that aren't part of a particular model are simply left `null` for those particular records. The table will also typically have a specific column that identifies which model a particular record represents.

Let's look at an example. Let's create a table that represents one of two models: Movie or Show.

```sql
CREATE TABLE titles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    
    -- Both movies and shows have a name
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    
    -- Only movies have a duration
    duration INTEGER,
    
    -- Only shows have a season count
    season_count INTEGER,

    -- This enum has two values -- 'Movie' and 'Show'
    kind title_kind_enum NOT NULL,
);
```

We can then include the types for `Movie` and `Show` in our schema:

```graphql
type Movie implements Title {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  duration: Integer
}

type Show implements Title {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  season_count: Integer
}
```

Now let's add the `Title` interface and make that a model:

```graphql
interface Title @model(table: "titles", pk: "id", includes: ["kind"]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

Note that we've set the `includes` argument to tell Sqlmancer to always include the `kind` column when querying the table. Now we just need to include a `resolveType` function in our resolver map:

```js
resolvers = {
  Title: {
    __resolveType: (title) => {
      // Will always return 'Movie' or 'Show', which matches the
      // names of the two types in our schema
      return title.kind
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

When resolving an abstract type, GraphQL by default looks for a `__typename` field on the returned object to determine its type. If you rename the `kind` column to `__typename`, you can skip adding a `resolveType` function altogether.

:::

You can now query `Title` like any other model. Sqlmancer will combine all the fields from both the `Movie` and `Show` types to determine the columns and relationships for the `Title` model.

## Using views

The above pattern will work pretty smoothly but requires you to utilize a single table. Having separate tables for each model is often desirable, though. You may also be adapting an existing database to use with Sqlmancer. In these cases, you can still use a view to combine two or more tables. For this example, we'll define our model using a CTE to create an "inline view", but you could define a view in your database and use that instead as well.

```graphql
interface Title @model(
  pk: "id",
  includes: ["kind"]
  cte: """
    SELECT
      id, name, duration, NULL as season_count, 'Movie' as kind
    FROM
      movies
    UNION
    SELECT
      id, name, NULL as duration, season_count, 'Show' as kind
    FROM
      shows
  """
) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

The above will work great if the primary key column is a UUID. If it's an auto-incrementing integer instead, you'll end up with collisions between the two tables so your CTE should account for that:

```sql
SELECT
  'Movie_' || id as id, name, duration, NULL as season_count, 'Movie' as kind
FROM
  movies
UNION
SELECT
  'Show_' || id as id, name, NULL as duration, season_count, 'Show' as kind
FROM
  shows
```

However, you'll probably want to make sure you convert these ids back to their original values in the response. You can do so using resolvers. For example:

```
const resolvers = {
  Movie: {
    id: (movie) => movie.id.replace(/\D/g,'')
  }
  Show: {
    id: (show) => show.id.replace(/\D/g,'')
  }
}
```
