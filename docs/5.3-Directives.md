## @col

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|`String!`|*none*|Name of column to associate with this field|

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@col` directive is used to explicitly set the name of the corresponding column for a field. If the directive is not used, Sqlmancer will use the name of the field instead, applying whatever transformation to the field's name was configured through the `transformFieldNames` argument of the `@sqlmancer` directive.

## @depend

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`on`|`[String!]!`|*none*|List of columns to select when requesting this field|

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@depend` directive is used to indicate a field is not associated with a particular column, but still *depends* on one or more columns. If the field is requested, the specified columns will be included in the request and available to the field's resolver.

## @hasDefault

**Arguments**

*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@hasDefault` directive is used to indicate the associated column has a default value. This means the field can have a non-nullable type without being required when creating a new instance of the model.

## @input

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`action`|`CREATE` or `UPDATE`|*none*|Whether to generate an input type for creating or updating a model record|
|`model`|`String`|*Field's type*|The model being created or updated|
|`list`|`Boolean`|`false`|Whether the added `input` argument should be a list of objects instead of an object|

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@input` directive will add an `input` argument to the field with a generated input type based on the provided model. The generated type will be different depending on the `action` argument. For `UPDATE`, all model fields are always nullable (optional). For `CREATE`, fields are only nullable (optional) if they are also nullable on the model type *or* if they have a `@hasDefault` directive.

## @ignore

**Arguments**

*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@ignore` directive is used to indicate the field has no associated column. Note: if a `@depend` or `@join` directive is used on a field, an `@ignore` directive is not necessary.

## @limit

**Arguments**

*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@limit` directive adds a `limit` argument to the field with a type of `Int`.

## @many

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`model`|`String`|*Field's type*|The model for which to generate the `where` and `orderBy` arguments|

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@many` directive can be used instead of separately applying the `@limit`, `@offset`, `@where` and `@orderBy` directives. The `model` argument may be omitted if the type of the field the directive is applied to is the target model.

## @model

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`table`|`String`|*none*|The name of the table (or view) in the database this model represents|
|`pk`|`String!`|*none*|The primary key column|
|`cte`|`String`|*none*|Common table expression used to create this model if it is an inline view|
|`readOnly`|`Boolean`|`false`|Whether the model should not include create, update or delete methods|
|`include`|`[String!]`|`[]`|Any *columns* (not necessarily fields) to always include when querying this model|

**Targets**
* `INTERFACE`
* `OBJECT`
* `UNION`

The `@model` directive indicates a data model should be generated for the specified type. Either the `table` argument or the `cte` argument are required. If the `@model` directive is used on a Union or Interface, then the fields of all possible types for that union or interface will be merged to determine the possible columns and associations for the model.

## @offset

**Arguments**

*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@offset` directive adds an `offset` argument to the field with a type of `Int`.

## @orderBy

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`model`|`String`|*Field's type*|The model for which to generate the `orderBy` argument|

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@orderBy` directive adds an `orderBy` argument to the field with a generated input type based on the field's type.

## @paginate

**Arguments**

*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@paginate` directive is an **optional directive** used to modify a field's type. The directive will generate a new output type representing a page of results based on the field's original type, which should be a model. For example, given these type definitions

```graphql
type Film @model(table: "film", pk: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  rentalCost: Float!
}

type Query {
  films: Film @paginate
}
```

the directive will generate these types

```graphql
type FilmPage {
  results: [Film!]!
  hasMore: Boolean!
  aggregate: FilmAggregate!
}

type FilmAggregate {
  count: Int!
  min: FilmAggregateMin!
  max: FilmAggregateMax!
  sum: FilmAggregateSum!
  avg: FilmAggregateAvg!
}

type FilmAggregateMin {
  id: ID
  title: String
  rentalCost: Float
}

type FilmAggregateMax {
  id: ID
  title: String
  rentalCost: Float
}

type FilmAggregateSum {
  rentalCost: Float
}

type FilmAggregateAvg {
  rentalCost: Float
}
```

and change the type of the field:

```
type Query {
  films: FilmPage!
}
```

The directive can be used in conjunction with the `paginate` client method, or for creating paginated relations using the `@relate` directive. However, use of the directive is completely optional -- you can always create your own types to limit which fields are exposed in your API.

## @private

**Arguments**

*none*

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`
* `INTERFACE`
* `OBJECT`
* `UNION`

The `@private` directive indicates a field or type should be removed from the schema. Sqlmancer will still parse fields and types removed this way when generating its data models. This allows you to include sensitive fields like passwords in the data model without exposing them through the API.

## @relate

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`on`|`[{ from: String!, to: String! }]`|*none*|The fields used to join the two tables|
|`through`|`String`|*none*|The name of the junction table|
|`pagination`|`OFFSET`|*none*|Indicates the type of pagination used by the field, if any|

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@relate` directive is used to a relation with another model. The `on` argument consists of one or two objects, each having a `from` and `to` field. If no junction table is used, `on` should receive a single object with the `from` indicating a column on this model's table and the `to` indicating a column on the related model's table.

If a junction table is used, `on` should receive two objects. The first object's `from` would be a column on this model's table and its `to` would be a column on the junction table. The second object's `from` would be a column on the junction table and its `to` would be a column on the related model's table. If a function table is used, the `through` argument should be provided as well to indicate the name of the junction table.

## @sqlmancer

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`dialect`|`POSTGRES` or `MYSQL` or `MARIADB` or `SQLITE`|*none*|The SQL dialect being used|
|`transformFieldNames`|`CAMEL_CASE` or `PASCAL_CASE` or `SNAKE_CASE`|*none*|The transformation to apply to a field name when determining the column name it matches|
|`customScalars`|`{ string: [String!], number: [String!], boolean: [String!], JSON: [String!], Date: [String!] }`|*none*|Used to map any custom scalars to their respective types. Not including a custom scalar means it will be omitted from a model's fields entirely. The type you map it to effects the TypeScript typings as well as any generated types (like those added with the `@where` and `@aggregate` directives).|

**Targets**
* `OBJECT`

The `@sqlmancer` directive is required and should be applied to your `Query` type.

## @value

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`is`|`String!`|*none*|The internal value to use instead of the enum value's name|

**Targets**
* `ENUM_VALUE`

The `@value` directive sets the internal value for an enum value. The directive should be utilized whenever the schema enum value doesn't match the enum value in the database (for example, if the database value includes a dash or other character prohibited by GraphQL). The directive is used in *instead* of utilizing the resolver map for the same purpose.

## @where

**Arguments**

|Name|Type|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`model`|`String`|*Field's type*|The model for which to generate the `where` argument|

**Targets**
* `FIELD_DEFINITION`

The `@where` directive adds an `where` argument to the field with a generated input type based on the field's type.
