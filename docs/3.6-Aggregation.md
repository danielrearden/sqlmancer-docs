## Aggregate queries

Each model exposes an `paginate` method that can be used to create a "page" object, as described in the [previous section](pagination). This object includes an `aggregate` property that can be populated by calling the appropriate `PaginateBuilder` methods:

```
const result = await Film.paginate()
  .count()
  .average('rentalCost')
  .max('title')
  .execute()
console.log(result)
```

would result in something like this object being printed to your console:

```
{
  aggregate: {
    count: 1000,
    average: {
      rentalCost: 4.79,
    },
    max: {
      title: 'Zoolander',
    },
  },
}
```

The available aggregate methods include `count`, `avg`, `sum`, `min` and `max`. The `PaginateBuilder` also exposes methods like `where`, `orderBy`, `limit` and `offset` to narrow down which records to aggregate.
