Query builders are initialized by calling the appropriate [client](functions#createsqlmancerclient) method. Most builder methods return the builder instance, so method calls can be chained easily. The underlying query will not be executed until `execute` is called on the builder instance.

### FindManyBuilder

Returns multiple records matching the provided criteria. Example:

```ts
const customers = await Customer.findMany().orderBy([{ lastName: 'ASC' }])
```

#### `execute`
```ts
public async execute<TRecord>(): Promise<TRecord[]>
```

Executes the query and returns a Promise with the result.

#### `toQueryBuilder`
```ts
public toQueryBuilder(): Knex.QueryBuilder
```

Transforms the query builder instance into an instance of a Knex query builder.

#### `transaction`
```ts
public transaction(transaction: Knex.Transaction | null): FindManyBuilder
```

Sets the transaction to be used by the query.

#### `select`
```ts
public select(...fields: ModelField[]): FindManyBuilder
```

Sets the `SELECT` clause for the query.

#### `selectAll`
```ts
public selectAll(): FindManyBuilder
```

Sets the `SELECT` clause for the query to all possible fields.

#### `addSelect`
```ts
public addSelect(...fields: ModelField[]): FindManyBuilder
```

Adds on to the `SELECT` clause for the query.

#### `load`
```ts
public load(
  name: string,
  getBuilder?: (builder: FindBuilder) => FindBuilder
): FindManyBuilder
public load(
  name: string,
  as: string,
  getBuilder?: (builder: FindBuilder) => FindBuilder
): FindManyBuilder
```

Eager loads the specified model relation. An optional alias can be provided to return the related model or models under a different property name. The `getBuilder` parameter is a function that's passed a fresh `FindOneBuilder` or `FindManyBuilder` instance for the associated model and should return the same kind of Builder instance.

#### `loadPaginated`
```ts
public loadPaginated(
  name: string,
  getBuilder?: (builder: PaginatedBuilder) => PaginatedBuilder
