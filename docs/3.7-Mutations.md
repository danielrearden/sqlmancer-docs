## Creating a record
```js
const id = await Film.createOne({
  title: 'Ghostbusters',
  description: 'Who you gonna call?'
}).execute();
```

This method returns the primary key value of the created record if the database supports returning the inserted data (Postgres, MariaDB). Otherwise, the auto-incremented id value (based on `LAST_INSERT_ID`) is returned, if available.

## Creating multiple records
```js
const ids = await Film.createMany([
  {
    title: 'Jaws',
    description: 'You\'ll never go in the water again.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Catch Me if You Can',
    description: 'The true story of a real fake',
  }
]).execute();
```

This method returns an array of the primary key values of the created records if the database supports returning the inserted data (Postgres, MariaDB). Otherwise, an array of the auto-incremented id values (based on `LAST_INSERT_ID`) is returned, if available.

## Updating a record by id
```js
const wasUpdated = await Film.updateById(
  102,
  { description: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' }
).execute();
```

This method returns a boolean indicating whether the record was updated. If the record could not be found, it will return `false`.

## Updating multiple records
```js
const numRowsUpdated = await Film.updateMany({ description: '[Redacted]' })
  .where({ description: { iLike: '%heck%' } })
  .execute();
```

This method returns the number of rows that were successfully updated.

## Deleting a record by id
```js
const wasDeleted = await Film.deleteById(102).execute();
```

This method returns a boolean indicating whether the record was deleted. If the record could not be found, it will return `false`.

## Deleting multiple records
```js
const numRowsDeleted = await Film.deleteMany()
  .where({ stars: { lessThanOrEqual: 1.5 } })
  .execute();
```

This method returns the number of rows that were successfully deleted.

## Transactions

Sqlmancer allows you to utilize a single transaction for multiple queries, ensuring that an operation takes place only if all operations in the transaction are also successful:

```js
const results = await client.transaction(trx => {
  const id1 = await Film.createOne({ title: 'Ghostbusters' })
    .transaction(trx)
    .execute();
  const id2 = await Film.createOne({ title: 'Ghostbusters 2' })
    .transaction(trx)
    .execute();
  return Film.findMany().where({ id: { in: [id1, id2] } })
    .transaction(trx)
    .execute();
});
```
